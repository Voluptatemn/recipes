        <p class="Description">Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish made of layered sheets of pasta interspersed with a variety of savory fillings. It's typically baked in an oven, creating a hearty, rich, and flavorful meal with a golden, bubbling top layer of melted cheese.</p>

            <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
            <li>9-12 lasagna pasta sheets (boil if needed, or use oven-ready)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Parmesan cheese (for topping)</li>
            <li>Fresh basil (optional, for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Meat Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sauté the Aromatics: Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. Cook for 5-7 minutes until softened and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Cook the Meat: Add the ground beef (or beef and pork mix) to the pan. Cook until browned, breaking it up into small pieces. Drain any excess fat, if necessary.</li>
            <li>Build the Sauce: Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, red wine, and broth. Stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Season It: Add the sugar, basil, oregano, bay leaves, salt, and black pepper. Mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Simmer the Sauce: Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer uncovered for 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened. Remove the bay leaves before using.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Prepare the Cheese Mixture</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of shredded mozzarella, 3/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, the egg, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix until fully combined.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Layer 1 (Base Layer): Spread a thin layer of meat sauce (about 1/2 cup) at the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish to prevent the pasta from sticking.</li>
            <li>Add the Pasta: Place 3-4 lasagna sheets on top of the sauce, covering the base</li>
            <li>Add the Cheese: Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the pasta.</li>
            <li>Add the Meat Sauce: Spoon 1/3 of the meat sauce on top.</li>
            <li>Repeat the Layers: Repeat the layers (pasta, ricotta cheese mixture, meat sauce) 2-3 times, depending on the depth of your dish.</li>
            <li>Top It Off: For the final layer, add the last of the meat sauce, pour the béchamel sauce (if using) on top, and sprinkle 1/2 cup mozzarella and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese for a golden, bubbly finish.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Bake the Lasagna</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cover with Foil: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (to prevent the top from burning) and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove Foil: Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes until the top is bubbly, golden brown, and slightly crispy.</li>
            <li>Rest the Lasagna: Remove from the oven and let it cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing. This resting period helps the layers set, making it easier to serve.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the Lasagna: Use a sharp knife to cut square portions of lasagna.</li>
            <li>Garnish: Garnish with fresh basil leaves and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Serve It Hot: Serve hot with garlic bread or a side salad.</li>
        </ol>
